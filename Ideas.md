## Double Q-Learning
Goal: reduces the over-estimation bias.

- (TD3) Fujimoto, Scott, Herke Hoof, and David Meger. **"Addressing function approximation error in actor-critic methods."** International Conference on Machine Learning. PMLR, 2018.


## Ensemble Models
Goal: avoids the policy from over-fitting to any single model during an episode, leading to more stable learning
